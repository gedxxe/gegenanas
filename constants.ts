export const MESSAGE = `amyyy, 2025 had its storms, its laughter, and its quiet moments. through it all, we stayed. thank you for being the kind of person who sees me, understands me, and still chooses to stay, even when i'm not the easiest to love.

as we step into 2026, i don't want to carry regrets. i want to carry lessons, love, and hope. i know i've made mistakes, and i'm sorry for every moment i made you feel anything less than cherished.

this year, i want to grow with you. not just in the good times, but through the messy, honest, beautiful parts of us. i want to be softer, stronger, and more present. for you, for us.

so here's to 2026: to healing, to laughter, to late-night talks, and to staying close no matter what.

happy new year, amyyy. let's keep choosing each other.`;
